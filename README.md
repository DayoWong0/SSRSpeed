## Important Hint

- The test results are for reference only and do not guarantee versatility.

- Before you publicly release your speed test results, be sure to ask the node owner if they agree to the release to avoid unnecessary disputes.
- SpeedTestNet and Fast.com is no longer supported.
- MacOS has not found a suitable way to detect libsodium, so be sure to ensure that libsodium is installed before testing nodes that use encryption methods such as chacha20.
- Shadowsocks-libev and Simple-Obfs are recommended to be installed using a compiled installation. It is known that the Shadowsocks-libev version in the Debian repository is too low to use some new encryption methods.
- If your hostname has non-ASCII characters, Web-UI will not work.

## Features

- Support for asynchronous file download testing.
- Support SpeedTestNet, Fast.com and socket download.
- Support for exporting result as json and png.
- Support batch import of configuration from GUI configuration file and SSPanel-v2, v3 subscription link.
- Support for importing data from any Json export file and re-exporting files of the specified format.
- Support WebUI
- Support Web page simulation test(Result export as HTML from template.).
- Automatic identification of proxy types.

~~~~

Example usage :

~~~~text
python main.py -c gui-config.json --include 韩国 --include-remark Azure --include-group YoYu
python main.py -u "https://home.yoyu.dev/subscriptionlink" --include 香港 Azure --include-group YoYu --exclude Azure
~~~~

The parameter priority is as follows:

> -i > -c > -u
> The above sequence indicates that if the parameter has a higher priority, the parameter will be used first, and other parameters will be ignored.
>
> --include > --include-group > --include-remark
> --exclude > --exclude-group > --exclude-remark
> The above sequence indicates that node filtering will be performed in descending order of priority.

### Web UI Usage

~~~~text
python web.py
You can now access the WebUI through http://127.0.0.1:10870
~~~~

## Modify the speed source of Socket mode

- Just modify the **link**, **size** attribute in the object with the tag "Default" and the tag "Google", where "link" is the download source and "size" is the file corresponding to the download source. Size (MBytes)
- For more advanced usage, please refer to the following [Advanced Usage]

## Advanced Usage

- **Rules**
  - The program has a built-in rule matching mode that allows specific ISPs or nodes in specific regions to use specific speed sources through custom rules for "Socket" test mode.Rules need to be written in config.py. Please see config.py for more details.
- **Custom color**
  - Users can customize the color of the resulting image in config.py. See the config.py file for sample configuration.

## Web Apis
